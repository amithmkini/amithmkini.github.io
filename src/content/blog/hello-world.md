description: Or the time I finally got around setting this up
---

Finally. It has taken me about 3 years to get to this point.

## Initial friction

Unlike the ancient times of the web where we had to setup our own wordpress servers, we don't have to do that now. Setting up a blog is as easy as clicking 3 buttons. Thanks to GitHub pages (where this is hosted right now) and other popular services, hosting is also not an issue. So why did it take me so long to get this up? Gunning for perfection.

I have come to a realization that there can be no blog if I am obsessive about the theme, page layout, hosting and so on. My policy on blogging, given the current age of GPT-4, is simply "write and publish": As long as you do it without the AI writing any portion of the blog. I've also decided not to care about the grammar, since a poor grammar will now indicate that a blog is indeed written by a human (remember LSTM models with terrible grammar?).

## Moving ahead

My focus with this blog will be mostly on software development (mainly AI and backend), but don't be surprised when I rant about other things in life. I'll try to use tags to organize my ramblings, but at present, I'm not even sure if I'll surpass 10 posts (given that there's 0 readers for this blog, at present). I'm going to target for at least 1 blog post per month, but let's see how that'll work. Till the next post, happy new year and wish you a successful year ahead.
